## cpma [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/konveyor/cpma.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/konveyor/cpma) [![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/aac7d46fd7899042ce52/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/konveyor/cpma/maintainability)
Control Plane Migration Assistant (CPMA) is a Command Line interface to help as much as possible users migrating an Openshift 3.7+ control plane configuration to an Openshift 4.x.
The utility provides Custom Ressource (CR) manifests and reports informing users which aspects of configuration can and cannot be migrated.

## Introduction

### Background

Openshift Container Platform (OCP) version 3 uses Ansible's openshift-ansible modules to allow for extensive configuration.

Meanwhile OCP 4.x uses openshift-installer which integrates with supported clouds for deployment, openshift-installer is a Day-1 operation and relies on [Operators](https://www.openshift.com/learn/topics/operators) to install and configure the cluster.

Many of the installation options available during install time in Openshift 3 are configurable by the user as Day-2 operations in Openshift 4.
In many cases this is done by writing CRs for operators which affect the configuration changes.

Since there is no direct upgrade path from OCP 3 to OCP 4, the goal of CPMA is to ease the transition between the 2 OCP versions involved.

### Goals

Bring the target Cluster to be as close as possible from the source cluster with the use of CR Manifests and report which configuration aspects can and cannot be migrated.
The tool effectively provides confidence information about each processed options to explain what is supported, fully, partially or not.
The generated CR Manifests can be applied to an Openshift 4 cluster as Day-2 operations.

### Non-Goals

Applying the CRs to the Openshift 4 cluster directly is currently not an intended feature for this utility.
The user must review the output CRs and filter the desired ones to be applied to a targeted OCP 4 cluster.
Migrating workloads are not to be done with CPMA, please use the workload migration tool for such purpose.

### Operation Overview

The purpose of the CPMA tool is to assist an administrator to migrate the control plane of an OpenShift cluster from version 3.7+ to its next major OpenShift version 4.x.
For that purpose CPMA sources information from:
- Cluster Configuration files:
  - Master Node:
    - Master configuration file - Usually /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml
    - CRIO configuration file - Usually /etc/crio/crio.conf
    - ETC configuration file - Usually /etc/etcd/etcd.conf
    - Image Registries file - Usually /etc/containers/registries.conf
    - Dependent configuration files:
      - Password files
        - HTPasswd, etc.
      - Configmaps
      - Secrets
- APIs
  - Kubernetes
  - Openshift

Configuration files are processed to generate equivalent Custom Resource manifest files which can then to be consumed by OCP 4.x Operators.
During that processs, every parameter that is analysed is ported when compatible to its equivalent.
A feature fully supported or not means there is a direct or not equivalent in OCP 4.
A partially supported parameter indicates the feature is note entirelly equivalent.
The reason for the latter is because some features are deprecated or used differently in OCP 4.
OCP 3 and 4 approach configuration management completely differently across.
Therefore it’s expected the tool cannot port all features across.

For more information about CPMA coverage please see [docs](./docs).

CPMA uses an ETL pattern to process the configuration files and query APIs which produce the output in two different forms:
- Custom Resource Manifest files in YAML format
- A report file (by default report.json) is produced by the reporting process

The user can then review the new configuration from the generated manifests and must aslo use the reports as a guide how to leverage the CRs to apply configuration to a newly installed Openshift 4 cluster. The reviewed configuration can then be used to update a targeted OpenShift cluster.

## Prerequisites
Prior to the execution of the assistant tool, the following must be met:

* The OCP source cluster must have be updated to the latest asynchronous release.
* The environment health check must have been executed to confirm there are no diagnostic errors or warnings.
* The OCP source cluster must meet all current prerequisites for the given version of OCP.
* The OCP source cluster must be at least of any of the versions 3.7, 3.9, 3.10 or 3.11.

### Authentication and authorization
* When using the remote mode, the ssh user provided to CPMA must have sudo permissions to read the configuration files.
  If this is not an option the files are to be copied locally and CPMA used in local mode.
* Kubernetes and Openshifts APIs are used by the tool. To be able to obtain a token the user must be already logged to the cluster. Use `oc login` to authenticate.
* When accessing cluster level resources through Kubernetes and Openshift APIs, the user (determined from Kubeconfig context) needs `cluster-admin` role.
  If needed add the role to the user, once logged as `system:admin`, using the following command:
  `oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin <username>`

## Warning

The CPMA tool is to assist with complex settings and therefore it’s mandatory to have read the corresponding documentation.
For more information please refer to:
- [OCP 3.x documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/welcome/index.html)
- [OCP 4.x documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/welcome/index.html)

## Installation

### Build from source

Requires go >= v1.11

This project uses Go Modules for managing dependencies. This means it can be
cloned and compiled outside of `GOPATH`.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/konveyor/cpma.git
$ cd cpma
$ make
$ ./bin/cpma
```
### CPMA Image

CPMA is also available in as an image, quay.io/ocpmigrate/cpma

Example Usage:
```
docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/mnt:z -v $HOME/.kube:/.kube:z -v $HOME/.ssh:/.ssh:z -u ${UID} \
quay.io/ocpmigrate/cpma:latest
```

Where `${PWD}` is mounted in the working directory of the image (`/mnt`). This means that paths provided to --config and --work-dir will need to specified be relative to your present working directory.

To make it a little more intuitive it can also be run via an alias, for example:
```console
$ alias cpma="docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/mnt:z -v $HOME/.kube:/.kube:z -v $HOME/.ssh:/.ssh:z \
-u ${UID} quay.io/ocpmigrate/cpma:latest"
```

  -w, --work-dir string            set application data working directory (Default ".")
```

Example:
```console
$ ./bin/cpma --config /path/to/config/.yml --debug
```

### User Prompt
The user will be prompted for required parameters

### Configuration file
The default CPMA configuration file is either `./cpma.json` or `~/cpma.json` unless an explicit path/name is provided (see --config option)

```json
clustername: openshift-testuser-example-com
configsource: remote
crioconfigfile: /etc/crio/crio.conf
debug: false
etcdconfigfile: /etc/etcd/etcd.conf
fetchfromremote: true
home: /home/testuser
hostname: master0.example.com
insecurehostkey: false
manifests: true
masterconfigfile: /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml
nodeconfigfile: /etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml
registriesconfigfile: /etc/containers/registries.conf
reporting: true
saveconfig: true
sshlogin: testuser
sshport: 0
sshprivatekey: /home/users/test/.ssh/testuser
silent: false
workdir: data

```

### Data file structure

CPMA data file structure looks like the following example.

```
data
├── manifests
├── master-0.example.com
|   └── etc
│       ├── containers
│       │   └── registries.conf
│       ├── etcd
│       │   └── etcd.conf
│       └── origin
│           └── master
│               ├── htpasswd
│               ├── master-config.yaml
│               ├── master.server.crt
│               └── master.server.key
└── report.hmtl
└── report.json
```

The `WorkDir` option ('data' in above example) determines the directory containing all data handled by CPMA.

The `manifests` subfolder will contain all generated Custom Resource manifests.

Each cluster endpoint is identified by its FQDN (master-0.example.com in above example) and its subfolders contain the configuration files retrieved which are to be processed.

And finally the reporting analysis generated as JSON and HTML formats are stored in the `report.html` and `report.json` files.

### Local or remote modes

CPMA can be used in either remote or local modes.
- In remote mode, CPMA retrieves the configuration files itself using SSH, which are then stored locally.
- Conversely, in local mode, configuration files must have been copied locally prior to launching CPMA.

Whether the files are retrieved by CPMA (remote mode) or manually (local mode), the tool always relies on the local file system to process a cluster node files using `<workDir>/<Hostname>/`.

## Debugging and troubleshooting
When using the debugging option `-d` or `--debug` more information is provided along the process to help troubleshooting.
A debug message provides a full path to the involved source file, the source line and a more detailed message.

|    `CPMA_SSHPORT`       |    SSH port                                                                                                       |
|    `CPMA_SSHPRIVATEKEY` |    Path for the private key                                                                                       |

The workflow involves:
1) Ensuring the cluster session is open.
2) Generating cluster report from cluster.
3) Parsing generated and local reports.
4) Comparison of reports.

Those are needed as a substitution of configuration or CLI input, so the test could run autonomously.
